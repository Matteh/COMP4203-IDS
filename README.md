COMP4203-IDS
============
The IDS requires root to get all device interfaces.
Use command "gksu eclipse" to give eclipse root permissions.

A basic UDP flooding script has been provided for testing purposes.
A few steps on running the UDP flood script.
  1. Routers will deny incoming data on most ports and port forwarding must be done.
  2. Run the script with command "python udp_flood-script.py".
  3. Enter desired inputs when prompted.
